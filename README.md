# Welcome to my Mock Tool Playground!
Basically, it's just a "playground" for my Python prototypes for my local science fair coming up, which focuses on robotic systems and CV uses within the biomedical field.
## Who?
I'll be using public medical and surgical datasets, so I'll be experimenting CV and ML with files (such as CV) of other people who I never met before, and afaik, I won't be getting any CT scans of my own that I can test in my models.
## What?
By the end of this deveopment phase, I aim to fully construct a working prototype of a dashboard that has a UI such that it can both serve the needs of a minimally-invasive surgical robot while also carrying out precise tasks through connectioning the surgeon/user to the robot (not what I'm developing).
## Where?
Here, in this repo!
## Why?
For my science fair competition, but also having an opportunity to work with peers and friends on a overall daunting project, which would help us to grow closer: I like collaborating!  Also, this is also an attempt to alleviate the mental and intellerctual stress that surgeons and doctors face every day, doing all of their surgeries for long durations or abnormal hours.
### Hackberry (by HC) Updates
I started creatigng commints for Hacberry (Hack Club's YSWS) starting October 9th, and all of the ommits since then pertain to a part of the CV that I use in my project.
